Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of Flipkart product reviews.
Ensure you have the dataset in a CSV file format with columns review and sentiment.
Place the dataset in the data/ directory.
Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: Load the reviews dataset using pandas.
Text Cleaning: Remove HTML tags, special characters, and perform other text cleaning steps.
Tokenization: Split the reviews into tokens (words).
Stop Words Removal: Remove common stop words that do not contribute to sentiment.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root forms.
Model Training
Vectorization: Convert the text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or Word2Vec.
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Choose a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
Training: Train the model on the training dataset.
Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset.
Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Results
Present the evaluation metrics.
Visualize the results using confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.
Usage
Predict Sentiment: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new reviews.

python
Copy code
from sentiment_analysis import predict_sentiment

review = "This product is amazing!"
sentiment = predict_sentiment(review)
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
Batch Predictions: Predict sentiments for a batch of reviews.

python
Copy code
reviews = ["This product is amazing!", "Not worth the price."]
sentiments = [predict_sentiment(review) for review in reviews]
print(f"Sentiments: {sentiments}")
